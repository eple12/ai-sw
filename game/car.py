"""Visual car: the model on screen, driven from the physics car's telemetry.

Four sources are supported, picked by the model *name* alone (config.PLAYER_MODEL
/ GHOST_MODEL), so switching between them is a one-line edit in config.py:

* ``bl_red`` / ``bl_white`` -- the default. The Blender car in
  ``blender/f1_car.py``, baked by ``tools/build_blender_f1.py`` into a .bam
  under ``assets/models/f1``.
* ``rb_red`` / ``rb_white`` -- the supplied fp04rb asset, baked the same way by
  ``tools/build_f1_asset.py``.
* ``f1red`` / ``f1white`` -- built from primitives at runtime by ``f1car.py``.
* anything else -- a .glb from the Kenney Racing Kit, CC0
  (``assets/models/kenney``, see its LICENSE.txt), through ``panda3d-gltf``.

A .bam arrives already in game coordinates with its wheel nodes attached and
its livery in the vertex colours, so it is used as-is; a .glb is authored in
its creator's own space and has to be scaled onto the physics wheelbase and
turned round first.

What is done here for every source is the part specific to this game: driving
the model from telemetry so the body rolls with real lateral acceleration,
pitches with real longitudinal acceleration, squats under real downforce, and
the wheels steer and spin at the real rates.
