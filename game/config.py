# Without it, a 575 hp rear-drive car at full throttle puts the rear tyres on

# for cornering -- so it snaps into a spin below about 100 km/h and never

# turn while slowing down.

# "whatever is left after the lateral demand" drops it to exactly zero once a
# tyre is near its cornering limit, so braking into a corner stopped slowing
# the car at all and it just washed wide -- which from the driver's seat reads
# as the steering not working. A real ABS modulates; it does not switch off.
#
# The floor is not a constant, because a constant silently decides how the car
# trail-brakes and leaves the driver out of it. Measured with a fixed floor at
# 200 km/h, brake and steering both pinned: 0.40 gave 0.85 g of decel against
# 1.75 g lateral (turns beautifully, barely slows), 0.70 gave 1.26 g / 1.35 g.
# Both are defensible; neither is something a single number should be choosing.
#
# So the reservation follows what the driver is actually asking for. Hard on
# the brakes with a small steering input reserves most of the circle for
# slowing; a dab of brake mid-corner reserves almost none and lets the tyre
# corner. The friction circle still caps the total either way -- this only
# decides who gets the scarce grip when both inputs want it.

STEER_ASSIST = True
# The assist must never fight a correction. It keys off total front slip, which

# was set that low back when full stick meant ~13x the angle the tyres could

# fine, progressive input at speed instead of arriving at the stop at once,
# while slow corners keep the quick rate above.
#
# The falloff is deliberately NOT linear in speed. Linear starts taking input
# away immediately, so the car already feels dulled at 100 km/h where it should
# still be sharp, and then has nothing left to give when it really matters.

# Available lock is derived from physics rather than from a hand-picked curve:
# at speed v the tyres can only use delta ~= atan(L * a_lat_max / v^2), so full
# stick is mapped onto that angle. Without this, full lock at 200 km/h asks for
# 13x more steering than the front axle can deliver -- the first few percent of
# input does everything and the rest is scrub, which is exactly what "too
# sensitive" feels like.
# Kept close to 1.0: with a keyboard the stick is always fully deflected, so a
# generous over-range means the front is permanently past its grip peak.
STEER_LIMIT_MARGIN = 1.12      # >1 so you can still provoke understeer/slides
# ...and more margin than that below the knee, on the same smoothstep the input
# rate uses, so the two speed-dependent effects share one shape.
#
# This is worth doing only because the grip-optimal lock sits on a broad
# plateau: measured at 100 km/h, 6 / 8 / 10 degrees give 43.4 / 44.3 / 44.2
# deg/s of yaw. So handing back a quarter more lock in the mid range costs
# under 1% of turn rate and buys a steering feel that stays sharp to 130 and
# then falls away, instead of collapsing before 100 and staying flat.

#   * a DENSE per-step speed-tracking reward against an ambitious speed profile
#     (the deployed raceline's curvature at RL_RL_SPEED_PACE): "be going THIS
#     fast here", a gradient from step one for braking zones and straights;
#   * a LAP-TIME BONUS awarded only on a clean finish-line crossing
#     (RL_RL_LAP_BASE - RL_RL_LAP_W * seconds, zero if the lap had more than
#     RL_RL_LAP_OFF_TOL off-track steps) -- makes "fast AND clean" the literal

# break-even of exactly 300/2.5=120.0 s -- which is Monza's OWN modelled lap
# time (120.6 s) to within 0.5 %, not a coincidence but an un-generalised
# calibration. It meant the bonus was healthy for Monza (94 s clean laps,
# well under 120) but effectively ZERO for Spa, whose clean laps (~122 s)
# sit ABOVE Spa's fixed 120 s break-even even though they are well inside
# Spa's own modelled lap (148.9 s) -- the "make fast-and-clean the literal
# payoff" mechanism that drove v27 past v18 on Monza was providing no
# gradient on Spa at all. Setting BASE = W * model_lap replicates the exact

                              # RL_POST_WIDEN_RAMP below for that idea.

# 2026-09-14: the "different idea". RL_LAP_W_RAMP's failure above raised only
# the reward for speed, not the price of risk -- so the policy pushed closer
# to the track limit for a bigger bonus, and the all-or-nothing clean-lap
# eval (any off-track tick zeroes the whole bonus) punished the resulting
# off-track ticks harder than the extra speed paid for. Motivated by Monza's
# episode-widening run (LONG_EPISODE_RATIO, rlenv.py; see the Kaggle README's
# episode-widening section): eval reach jumped from 7,711 m (the pre-widening
# PERFECT) to a steady 13,000-13,700 m within 100 iterations of widening --
# so the policy plainly COULD cover a full second lap at pace, it just
# couldn't yet do it clean, every single post-widening eval came back
# off-track or wall/recover. RL_POST_WIDEN_RAMP scales RL_OFF_TRACK_COST and
# RL_RL_LAP_W by the SAME factor instead of RL_RL_LAP_W alone, so the
# relative price of "clean" vs "fast" never shifts (whatever policy was
# already optimal stays optimal) -- only their combined signal grows
# relative to the unscaled per-step progress/time reward (RL_PROGRESS_W /
# RL_TIME_W), sharpening the "stay clean, get faster" gradient without
# incentivising more risk-taking near the limit. Keyed to decisions SINCE
# episode widening (train_iqn_gpu.py tracks the exact seen-count of the eval
# that triggered it), not decisions since training start, since widening is
# exactly the moment "clean" gets categorically harder (1 lap -> 2) and is
# when this extra push is wanted -- inert (1.0) the entire time before that,
# including through the ordinary pre-widening PERFECT climb. Flat
# ((0,1),(1,1)) disables it. Only wired into train_iqn_gpu.py (the GPU
# trainer used for real runs), not train_iqn.py.
#
# 2026-09-14: first guess was (0,1.0),(1_000_000,1.8) -- tested on Monza
# (with --post-widen-start-at-line, below) and it reproduced EXACTLY the
# moving-target failure mode RL_OFF_TRACK_COST_RAMP's own comment already
# diagnosed once: all 4 widened PERFECTs (it1075/1150/1175/1200, best lap
# 93.7 s) landed while this ramp was still climbing (roughly 1.3x-1.6x of
# its way to 1.8x, well short of flat), and the policy then went off-track
# on every single eval for the remaining 575 stale-stop iterations -- almost
# exactly the window where the ramp kept climbing the rest of the way to its
# 1.8x ceiling. First fix: shortened the window to 300k decisions, so it
# reaches flat well before ~400k (roughly where that run's first widened
# PERFECT appeared). Retested and confirmed on Monza: 93.30 s, beating the
# 93.60 s record outright.
#
# 2026-09-14, second pass: a fixed decision count is itself circuit-
# specific in exactly the way EPISODE_SECONDS_BY_CIRCUIT/LONG_EPISODE_RATIO
# already flagged once for episode_seconds (rlenv.py) -- 300k was tuned to
# ONE circuit's observed timing, and a track that takes meaningfully longer
# (or shorter) than Monza to re-clear the harder post-widening PERFECT bar
# has no reason to share it: too short just means extra sharpening tops out
# early (harmless, the same flat-and-safe state as before widening even
# starts), but too long reproduces the exact moving-target problem this was
# meant to fix, just later. So train_iqn_gpu.py now FREEZES the ramp at
# whatever value it has reached the moment a post-widening PERFECT is first
# actually seen (see post_widen_ramp_freeze in harvest()), rather than
# trusting a fixed window to land before that happens. The window below only
# controls how fast the ramp climbs while still searching -- it no longer
# needs to be calibrated per circuit, since freezing does the actual job now.
# 2026-09-14: re-enabled after --n-step=6 alone showed a genuinely faster
# line but zero widened-PERFECTs -- except the run that actually tested it
# (Monza_v26k_scratch, 91.30 s) turned out to have been pushed to Kaggle
# BEFORE this re-enable landed, so its one widened PERFECT (it725, 67,200
# decisions after widening) froze the ramp at 1.00x -- i.e. it was never
# actually active. That result says nothing about whether the ramp helps;
# it says n-step + the cleaner reward/observation alone can find a fast
# line, and that PERFECT recurring even once in 600 iterations can still be
# luck rather than a solved mechanism (this run had exactly one hit, then
# stale-stopped). 2026-09-15: OFF again (flat) while EPISODE_WIDEN_STAGES
# (rlenv.py) is tried instead -- a different lever on the same "PERFECT
# doesn't reliably recur past a hard difficulty jump" problem, but one that
# changes the TASK (smaller jumps) rather than the incentive (steeper
# reward). Keeping both off at once isolates which one, if either, is
# actually doing the work.
