"""Race control: the stewards for a twenty-car grand prix.

The cars (``field.py``) report what happened -- a trip off the road
(``rules.Excursion``), a contact between two bodies -- and this decides what
it deserves, the way a modern F1 stewards' room does, with one aim above the
rest: **a player should never be punished for something that was not their
fault, nor for a mistake that already cost them time.**

Track limits (all four wheels past the white line):

* **Pushed off.** Any car-to-car contact in the few seconds before: nothing.
* **Lost time.** The car spun, ran through the gravel, came back slow: the
  mistake was its own penalty. Nothing.
* **Gained time.** The lap advanced further than the car drove -- a cut. A
  time penalty that always outweighs the gain: ``ceil(2 x gain) + 1`` s,
  ``GAIN_PEN`` (5 s) at the least -- the heaviest thing a track-limits trip
  can cost, as in F1; past 10 s, a gross short cut, the gain plus 10 s.
* **Ran wide, kept going.** A *strike*. Three are warnings (the third shows
  the black-and-white flag); from the fourth, each costs the level's strike
  penalty (``teams.Level.strike_pen``: 0 on Novice, where it stays a warning,
  1 s on Rookie and Amateur, 2 s above) -- always less than a cut's.

Collisions (above ``contact.HIT_IMPULSE``) are judged on the geometry the
moment they happen:

* **One car behind the other** (less than half a car overlapping): the car
  behind, closing at more than ``REAR_CLOSING``, ran into the back of the
  one in front -- its fault. Otherwise, a racing incident.
* **Alongside**: the car that was moving across into the other, clearly
  faster than the other was moving across into it -- its fault. Otherwise,
  a racing incident.

What the guilty car gets depends on what it did to the other one: if the
victim spun, went off or needed recovering within ``CONSEQUENCE_T`` seconds,
or the hit was heavy, a 5 s penalty; a light touch with no consequence is a
warning, and only a repeat (on levels that say so) is penalised -- and on
the opening lap, where the whole field shares one braking zone, not even
that. Racing incidents get no action, and the player is told so, so a
contact never leaves them wondering whether a penalty is coming.

Yellow flags (a stricken car: stopped, or being recovered):

* **No overtaking** in the yellow zone, bar the stricken car itself. The
  car that passed is told to give the place back; if it has within
  ``GIVE_BACK_T``, nothing more, otherwise ``YELLOW_PEN``.
* **Slow down.** Through the zone a car must run clearly slower than it did
  at the same place on its previous lap (``YELLOW_SLOW_RATIO`` of that
  speed, on average over the zone). The first time is a warning; a repeat
  costs ``YELLOW_PEN`` on levels that penalise repeats. With no previous
  lap to compare against (lap 1) there is nothing to judge on.

Time penalties are added to the race time at the flag, as in F1 when there is
no pit stop to serve them at.
