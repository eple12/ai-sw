"""A race driver: the minimum-time plan, plus everyone else on the track.

Alone, a car should drive its solved plan (``mintime_driver``). In a field it
cannot always: someone is in the way, someone is alongside, it got hit and is
facing the barrier. This module decides, every tenth of a second, WHERE across
the road to drive and how fast -- and hands that to the same ``PlanFollower``
the solo driver uses, as a sideways offset from the plan and a speed cap.

The layers, each measured in ``tools/race_sim.py`` before it stayed:

* **Avoidance (every 0.1 s).** A handful of lanes -- "the plan's line shifted
  N metres sideways" -- are rolled forward three seconds along this driver's
  speed profile (the plan's speeds, cut where a lane's own curvature, corner
  or lane change, needs it), against every nearby car rolled forward along
  the reference plan at its own pace. Running into a car ALONGSIDE is a
  squeeze and all but forbidden; running into one AHEAD within 1.2 s makes
  the lane a queue. The plan's line is strongly preferred: this layer keeps
  cars apart, it does not try to pass.
* **Room (every tick).** With a car overlapping alongside, the lane may not
  come within a body width of it -- the hard version of the squeeze rule.
* **Following (every tick).** Never closer than it can brake to the speed
  the car ahead will have a moment later; and, close behind it, no faster at
  each point than it went there (so a slower car is matched BEFORE its slower
  corner, not by braking mid-corner with the grip already spent turning).
* **Passing.** Faster than the car ahead (by its observed pace): tuck into
  its tow down the straight -- the field gives DRS within a second -- pull out
  beside it before a heavy braking zone and draw past; ahead by the braking
  zone's settle point, take the line; not, tuck back in. A car alongside
  into a corner with its nose ahead is yielded to.
* **Incidents.** A car stopped or recovering ahead brings a yellow flag:
  lift, no passing. The car itself stops, turns (reversing off a barrier if
  it must), waits beyond the kerb -- not on the racing line -- for a gap in
  the traffic, and merges; the field ghosts it until it is clear (field.py).
